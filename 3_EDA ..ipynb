        " Annual salaries rise steadily from **2021 to 2026**, with the **mean increasing from ~50,727 to ~68,201** and the **median following the same upward path**. **Minimum salaries stay fixed at 13,000, while maximum salaries fluctuate sharply, peaking at 520,000 in 2023 and 350,000 in 2025–2026**. **Standard deviation grows, showing widening pay variation.**\n",

        "     Compensation trends point to systematic salary growth across the workforce, likely driven by policy or inflation adjustments. Rising mean and median confirm broad‑based increases, while spikes in maximum salaries highlight outliers that skew distribution. The data reflects both predictable upward salary trends and growing inequality in pay levels."

        "\n",
        "- **Inflation:**\n",
        "As the cost of living increases, salaries are raised to maintain employees’ purchasing power. This explains the consistent upward trend across the workforce.\n",
        "- **Industry Growth & Talent Retention:**\n",
        " Expanding industries or competitive labor markets push companies to increase pay to attract and retain skilled employees.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Outliers in Maximum Salaries:**\n",
        " The sharp spikes in maximum salaries (e.g., 520,000 in 2023) are likely due to exceptional roles, executive packages, or one‑off contracts. These outliers skew the distribution and inflate the standard deviation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Growing Inequality:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   While the mean and median show broad‑based growth, the rising standard deviation indicates widening pay gaps. A small group of employees earns disproportionately high salaries compared to the majority, creating inequality.\n",

Certain job roles consistently receive higher average salaries within specific departments, while other roles show gradual increases over time. Year-wise changes in salary levels indicate both steady growth in some roles and fluctuations in others, suggesting differences in career progression, departmental priorities, and workforce structure.\n",

Higher salaries are typically associated with senior or specialized roles and departments requiring advanced skills. Year-on-year salary changes reflect factors such as promotions, experience accumulation, policy revisions, and organizational growth. Overall, this multivariate analysis provides a comprehensive view of how role hierarchy and departmental context shape salary trends over time."
